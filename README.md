## Overview

Welcome to **Express.js Practice** — a personal learning Repo created to explore and strengthen my understanding of **Express.js**, the most popular Node.js web framework.

This project contains several small, self-contained examples and mini-projects.  
Each folder represents a core concept of backend development with Express — making this repo a solid reference for learners and developers who want to build real-world server applications.
